                        <p>
                            I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin – Green Bay. I plan to graduate in May of 2016 with a B.S. of Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy.
                            <br /><br />
                            As a soon to be graduate, I am eager that so many paths are laid out before me. Some key qualities I bring to the table are commitment to excellence, value to the company, quick learning, and the ability to get the “big picture”.
                            <br /><br />
                            My degree in Computer Science and minor in Philosophy have blended wonderfully to give me a truly custom degree and feel. Not only have I learned to develop quality software products, I also gained a unique perspective on critical thinking, effective argumentation, and general human excellence.
                            <br /><br />
                            In other words, if you have a need for a young individual who is committed to excellence, valuable, a quick learner, and gets the big picture, please reach out to me at norttj21@uwgb.edu. I would love to see what path you have to offer!
