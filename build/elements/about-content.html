                            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

                            <p>As an Information Technology Intern at Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, I have been involved with multiple Interactive projects. Most notably, during the summer of 2015 I aided the team in developing an analytics dashboard for our web services. We developed a RESTful API to gather and distribute response/availability data for our web services. I then created a responsive frontend to display this data for our team. I gained valuable experience using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>JQuery</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b>, <b>.NET</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>Entity Framework</b> and more. Additionally, I am currently involved with an initiative to build a dashboard for error logging from our desktop and web applications. This dashboard is built with <b>AngularJS</b>, and the <b>ASP.NET MVC</b> framework.</p>

                            <p>In 2012, I became the Webmaster for a new non-profit organization named GreenLifeXpo. As the Webmaster, I helped GreenLifeXpo create an online presence to build their brand. Over the course of four years I designed, implemented, and maintained ‘greenlifexpo.com’. This site was developed using Adobe Muse, a WYSIWYG based software; in other words there was a lot less coding. However, considering I undertook this work before my college career, it was a good first exposure to design and the practice of web development. I The last version of it under my supervision may be viewed at <span><a href="http://greenlifexpo.altervista.org">greenlifexpo.altervista.org</a></span></p>

                            <h3>Personal & Academic Projects</h3>

                            <p>Most of my projects are either from educational or personal experience. The project I am most proud of is a personal project in development at the moment; you're looking at it right now! My web app is built with <b>Polymer 1.0</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>JSON</b>, and <b>GULP</b>. Currently, it is still in development; it has been in the works since December of 2015. Check it out; there you can see more detailed information on my other projects.</p>

                            <p>Another project I am very excited about is ProteinHelper, an <b>Android</b> app I created for a final project in a Mobile Applications class. ProteinHelper was developed in the fall of 2015. It was written in <b>C#</b> and developed in <b>Xamarin Studio</b>. This app allows users to scan in food items by UPC, store those items in a <b>SQLite</b> database, and then query the database for specific results. The aim of the app is to help users find food items in their cupboards they can eat to fulfill their daily protein intake.</p>

                            <p>The last project I am very excited about is ParkingMaster. ParkingMaster is a desktop application built with <b>Java</b> and <b>SQL</b>. This app was developed to help parking garages manage parking availability, their ticket system, and online reservations. It was developed as a team for my Software Engineering course in spring of 2015.</p> 

                            Again, if you would like to take a look at these projects or more, head over to the Project section.


                            <h3>What I'm looking to do next</h3>
                            <p>I am very open to <i>where</i> I will work and <i>what</i> I will start my career in.</p>

                            <p><b>WHERE</b> - I am willing to relocate; looking for a new adventure with a company I can make an impact at right away.</p>

                            <p><b>WHAT</b> - I have experience in web, mobile, and desktop application development. I could see myself doing any one of these three. If I find an exciting job that helps further the legacy of the company and challenges myself, it is fair game.</p>

                            <p>Thanks for taking the time to look at my personal web app, I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
